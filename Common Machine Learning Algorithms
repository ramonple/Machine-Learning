------------------------------------- Supervised Machine Learning

Regression & Classification

>>> Regression:
linear regression, polynomial regression, ridge regression, LASSO regression

>>> Classification:
logistic regression (ROC curve) 
KNN:  can be applied to both classification and regression problems
SVM  (entropy)
Decision Trees
Navie Bayes

Bagging (Boostrap aggregating) :
 a. Random forest
 b. AdaBoost ( relationship with Random forest)
 c. Gradient Boosting
 
 
-------------------------------------  UnSupervised Machine Learning

              < Clustering >                                      < Dimensionality Reduction >
Examples:
             K - means                                         Principal Components Analysis
             Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering             Non-nagative Matrix Factorization
             DBSCAN                  
             Mean Shift 

K - means: Inertia, --> differences with KNN
    --> Distance metrics: Euclidean, Mahattan, Cosine
    
Mean Shift: highest density to be the centroid,
